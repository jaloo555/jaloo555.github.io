> Writeups for Overthewire Bandit

This is a detailed write-up of my solutions to problems 14-34 for the Bandit wargame. This wargame is aimed at beginners, each level contains a password used to gain access to the next level. The game is linear, you start at Level 0 and move up towards Level 34. All passwords have been censored out of respect for the wargame and future players.

Due to the time of creating this board, I've decided to start the write up at level 14.

# Level 14 â†’ Level 15
