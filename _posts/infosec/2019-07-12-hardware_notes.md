# Hardware

Here, I will be posting all my notes regarding hardware and virtualization.

### Motherboard
- Different sizes: E-atx (extended), atx, micro-atx, mini-itx
- Sockets: the connector the CPU processor has. It has to match with the motherboard socket.
- Buses: Moves data between components that connect the motherboard.

### Processors
- Cores: Responsible for executing instructions
- Clock speed: Instructions executed per second (1 Hz - 1 instruction per second, 1 GHz - 1 billion instructions per second)
- Context switching: Processor sharing processor time between applications.
- Heat sink: thermally conductive material, drags heat away. Thermal paste conducts heat and traps air (good insulator)

### RAM
- Think of it as the number of memory available to run programs
- Faster speed (read data from ram), Volatile
- DDR4 (double data rate fourth generation) - newest

### Storage
- Desktops use 3.5 inch whilst laptops uses 2.5 inch form-factors
- Mechanical: Slower than ssd, has moving parts and wears out
- SSD: Faster, no moving parts, more reliable

### GPU
- Dedicated processor performing calculations for graphics, also has dedicated RAM in it
- Also used for encryption, cracking numbers, 3d rendering

### PSU
- Drives power from power to components such as motherboard, graphics card and hard drives
- 4 pin peripheral connector powers fans, SATA powers hard drives, 20/24 pin connects motherboard, PCI-E powers graphic cards

### IO devices

##### Input
- USB 
  - USB 1 - Transfer Speed: 1.5 Mbit/s
  - USB 2 - Transfer Speed: 480 Mbit/s
  - USB 3 - Transfer Speed: 4 Gbit/s (You can usually tell if a port is USB 3 compatible because the port will be coloured  blue)
  - USB 3.1 - Transfer Speed: 10 Gbit/s (You can usually tell if a port is USB 3.1 compatible because the port will be coloured turquoise)
- PS/2 ports for older peripherals

##### Output
- VGA: the oldest standard for A/V output
- DVI: a more modern version of VGI
- HDMI: more modern, can also transmit audio
- Display port / usb-c: newest standard
