> Infosec is a vast field, here's my plan

## Gameplan

1. Overthewire (Bandit)
2. Building a homelab 
3. Cyberstart (A program for college students)
4. Tryhackme (OWASP, Pentesting)
5. Pentesterlab (Web pentesting)
6. PicoCTF
7. Hacker101

## Details

I will begin by tackling the list in my gameplan one-by-one, and post writeups on this site.

- Overthewire will teach me the basics of *nix terminals, bash, networking and all the good stuff
- Building a homelab will further my knowledge in networking, virtualization and blue team stuff as I will attempt to implement ESXi (a baremetal hypervisor) on a old server I have. I will also try to setup active directories, implement pfSense, an IDS/IPS, DMZ zones, and setup a VPN. (I have no idea what I'm saying, but we'll get there)
- Cyberstart is a college cybersecurity program I signed up for that will teach me basics of CTFs and other infosec stuff. I hope it's good.
- Tryhackme is a relatively new player that teaches hacking. I will try it out and see what I can learn from it.
- Pentesterlab has really good reviews for teaching web pentesting. I will look into the bootcamp route and try to get as prepared as possible for future bug bounty programs.
- PicoCTF means more learning in order to prep for future CTFs
- Hacker101 is a bug bounty platform that I will test my skills in.
- More to come...
